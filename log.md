# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started making some pure CSS images.

**Thoughts:**: It's harder than it seems and I need to learn a lot more about _transform_.

### Day 2: February 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Played aroud with vue.js and firebase. The plan is to make an actual blog of my 100 days of progress, with pretty pictures, links to the projects and everything. I did not, however made any significant progress. :disappointed:

**Thoughts:**: I'm gonna need to start from somewhere.. easier. But now I see kinda what's required, so I'll keep working on it.
